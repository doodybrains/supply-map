# SUPPLY MAP

SITE HERE: http://supply-map.net/

## To run locally:

`npm install`

`npm run start`

note: You'll need an API key for the Google Sheet and Mapbox in order to pull in live data. The Google Sheet is output as a csv. To use this code with your own data you will need to add a .env.development file to the folder root and add the following items:

```
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_SHEET=link-for-your-google-sheet-output-as-csv

REACT_APP_MAPBOX=api-key-for-your-mapbox-account
```

## How to get involved:

We are looking for help in either:
1. __Maintaining or contributing to the spreadsheet__ of supply location information that's powering this site. If you are an organization that is compiling similar resources we'd love to collaborate with you!
2. __Contributing to the code.__ Please submit issues to this github repo as they come up. Feel free to fork for your own purposes, or open pull requests to contribute to this one!

Contact @doodybrains or @jackieis_online on Twitter to get involved in this project!

Thank you to Dan Shiffman for the technical resources and all of our volunteers.
